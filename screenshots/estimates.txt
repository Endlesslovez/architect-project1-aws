In a Multi-AZ, multi-region database setup, the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are crucial metrics in ensuring data resilience and availability. For a single Availability Zone (AZ) outage, the minimum RTO can be remarkably low, often within minutes or even seconds. This is because the database automatically fails over to a standby instance in a different AZ, ensuring minimal downtime. Similarly, in the case of a single region outage, the minimum RTO can still be relatively low, typically within minutes, due to the failover mechanisms across regions. However, for both single AZ and single region outages, the minimum RPO can be slightly higher. The RPO represents the acceptable data loss window, and in these scenarios, it may be a matter of seconds or a few minutes, depending on the replication lag between the primary and standby instances. Nonetheless, with efficient data replication and synchronization processes, organizations can strive for minimal data loss even in the face of such outages, ensuring data integrity and business continuity.
